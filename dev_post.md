series: {real steel boxing with your voice series}
### Overview of My Submission
Have you ever wondered how the voice recognition in the **Noicy Boy** from **Real Steel movie**worked. For people who are new to Real Steel and haven't watched that movie yet. Watch at least the trainer and continue here.
I was wondering if I could do the same with Deepgram's real-time speech to text api. The result of two day hustle and surprise!! surprise!! It just worked.
### It really works 🐱‍🏍
I initially though it won't since there is a considerable latency between the time you say something and the action will take place after `50 ms`. But this was instantaneous or too close `less than 3 ms`. Seems like you can take on any league games on World Robot Boxing.
