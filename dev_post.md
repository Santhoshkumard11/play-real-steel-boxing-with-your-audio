### Overview of My Submission
Have you ever wondered how the voice recognition in the **Noisy Boy** from **Real Steel movie** works. For people who are new to Real Steel and haven't watched that movie yet. Watch at least the trainer and continue here.
I was wondering if I could do the same with Deepgram's real-time speech to text api. The result of two day hustle and surprise!! surprise!! It just worked.
### It really really works üê±‚Äçüèç
I initially with the impression it won't since there is a considerable latency between the time you say something, it has to process it, send it back and the action will take place after __100 ms__ or so. But this was instantaneous or too close __less than 3 ms__. Seems like you can take on any league games on World Robot Boxing.
