If you haven't read the first series, please read that and come back here.

Let's continue from where we left of last time.

I'm really impressed by the speed at which the transcription is generated to match the speed of the game.
There can be a lot more done to make sure it's even more faster or we could also make it real-time or at least near real-time. But that's a task for another hackathon.

With that said below is the Live Demo that you can watch to see how the real-time transcription is working and at what speed we get the transcripts from the `Deepgram servers`.

### Conclusion
The repo is public now so you guys can try building something on top of what I've done, would love to see what you're planning to go with this.
You don't really need a Flask application to run this, it's just for the demo purpose that I've used to show the power of Deepgram APIs.
You can read more about SDKs available for Deepgram [here](https://developers.deepgram.com/).

There are lot of example that you can look up to in the Use Case section, just to make yourself comfortable with the usage of real-time speech transcription or Deepgram APIs in general.

Happy Learning!
