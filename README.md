# Play Real Steel Boxing with your voice ðŸ”ŠðŸ”Š - Real-time speech transcription with Deepgram

Totally inspired by **Real Steel Movie** and curiosity to build things.

Have you ever wondered how the voice recognition in the **Noisy Boy** from **Real Steel movie** works. For people who are new to Real Steel and haven't watched that movie yet. Watch at least the trainer and continue here.
I was wondering if I could do the same with **Deepgram's real-time speech to text API**. 

#### The result of two day hustle and surprise!! surprise!! It just worked. âœ¨
